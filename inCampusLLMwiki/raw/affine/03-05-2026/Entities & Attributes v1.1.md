# Entities & Attributes v1.1

# Version log

\| 1.1 | 2026-05-01 | Student Account attributes | Added `CampusInsightSharingConsent` to control whether identifiable profile-interest and activity-participation insight data may be accessed by authorized campus staff. | Required to support future campus-level student-life insight access without treating admin access as unrestricted by default. | Campus insight access discussion; privacy and consent alignment | 

# Entity Attributes Catalog

## Overview

This document refactors the updated entity and attribute documentation into a structured Markdown catalog for technical review. It preserves the entities, attributes, grouped attributes, constraints, defaults, and relationship hints from the updated source page while marking unresolved or cross-document inconsistencies as `To verify`.

Sources consulted:

* Repository wiki: `inCampusLLMwiki/wiki/architecture/data-stores.md`, `inCampusLLMwiki/wiki/architecture/data-flow.md`, `inCampusLLMwiki/wiki/architecture/crud-matrix.md`, and the 2026-04-25 subgroup workdocs for CA, AP, H\&L, D\&P, SM, and NSF.
* Implementation schemas/models/migrations/API DTOs were not found in the repository. The available source code is the wiki viewer application, not the inCampus domain model, so attribute-level schema validation is documentation-derived.

Catalog conventions:

* Entity names follow the updated source page unless a repository wiki naming mismatch is explicitly noted.
* Attribute counts in the summary count leaf attributes only. Explicit grouped or compound headings are preserved in the entity tables but are not counted as leaf attributes.
* `Required` uses `Yes`, `No`, or `To verify`. Conditional fields are marked `No` and their conditional requirement is described in `Constraints / Notes`.
* `To verify` is used only where the available documentation leaves a field, type, default, inclusion, or naming decision unresolved.

#### Validation Notes

* `Activity Category` is one typed use of `DS-CA-002 Campus Structured Options`, not a separate store.
* The updated relationship table includes `Activity Category` classifying `Activity`.
* The updated source resolves activity category storage as `Activity.Category.CategoryID` plus a `CategoryLabel` snapshot.

#### Open Questions

* Category uniqueness scope, for example unique `CategoryName` per campus, is `To verify`.

### Campus Admin

**Description:** Authorized staff account used to manage campus configurations, structured options, and moderation reports.

**Module / Area:** Campus Administration / `DS-CA-003 Campus Admin` (Proposed).

**Relationships:** Manages `Campus` (M:N authorization), reviews `Report Record`.

#### Attributes

| Attribute   | Type          | Required | Default        | Description                                    | Constraints / Notes                            |

| IsActive    | Boolean       | Yes      | True           | Indicates if the admin account is active.      | `False` prevents login and moderation actions. |

#### Validation Notes

* Required to resolve ownership of campus setup and moderation review.
* Authorization to specific campuses is handled via relationship (M:N Admin to Campus), not a single attribute, aligning with the CA workdoc which mentions "restricted list of campuses for which that admin is explicitly authorized".

#### Open Questions

* Exact administrative authentication flow (e.g., standard login vs enterprise SSO) is `To verify`.

### Student Account

**Description:** Internal student access identity used to control registration, verification, campus onboarding, and platform access.

**Module / Area:** Access and Profile / `DS-AP-001 Student Account`.

#### Validation Notes

* Current CRUD behavior stores selected campus association in `DS-AP-001 Student Account`.
* The repository wiki preserves a wording mismatch where one older store definition places campus selection under `DS-AP-002`; the AP workdoc follows `DS-AP-001`.
* `UniversityEmail` validation is based on a domain-match rule, not necessarily a direct foreign key.

#### Open Questions

* Exact university verification mechanism is `To verify`.
* Exact uniqueness scope for `UniversityStudentID` is `To verify`.
* Whether `SelectedCampusID` becomes mandatory after onboarding completion is `To verify`.

### Student Profile

**Description:** Public-facing minimal student profile shown in allowed campus/activity contexts.

**Module / Area:** Access and Profile / `DS-AP-002 Student Profile` in the updated source; historically `Student Minimal Profile` in the repository wiki.

**Relationships:** Owned by `Student Account`; read in controlled contexts such as join-request review and activity detail/profile exposure, subject to `Block Relationship` checks.

#### Validation Notes

* The updated source uses `Student Profile`; canonical wiki pages and `DS-AP-002` still frequently use `Student Minimal Profile`.
* AP wiki pages explicitly state that exact minimal profile fields remain unresolved. The updated source provides a concrete candidate list, so fields are preserved but uncertainty is marked.
* Block checks are mandatory before profile exposure to another student.

#### Open Questions

* Official final entity label, `Student Profile` vs `Student Minimal Profile`, is `To verify`.
* Final inclusion of `Languages` and `ShortBio` is `To verify` because the source marks them as suggested fields.
* Required/optional status for `Major` is `To verify`.
* Exact allowed profile-viewing contexts are `To verify`.

### University Identity Rule

**Description:** Rule used to validate whether an email domain belongs to a supported university.

**Module / Area:** Access and Profile / `DS-AP-003 University Identity Rules`.

#### Validation Notes

* Validation is documented as domain matching against `StudentAccount.UniversityEmail`; it is not necessarily a direct foreign key.
* The AP workdoc confirms the store but leaves the technical verification mechanism abstract.

#### Open Questions

* Exact technical or organizational verification mechanism is `To verify`.
* Formal syntax for `StudentIDFormatRule` is `To verify`.

### Notification Record

**Description:** Stored notification consequence used for push/in-app notification and later navigation to the relevant app context.

**Module / Area:** Notifications and System Flow / `DS-NS-001 Notification Records`.

**Relationships:** Received by `Student Account`, may reference `Activity` and `Participation`, and may record a triggering `Student Account`.

#### Validation Notes

* `DS-NS-001` stores notification consequences and references only. It must not duplicate activity, participation, account, or block truth.
* Cross-user notifications require block suppression checks; activity reminders use participation/lifecycle validity instead.
* Opening a notification is read-only in the current architecture and must not update notification, activity, or participation state unless a future requirement adds read/unread behavior.

#### Open Questions

* Exact notification payload schema is `To verify`.
* Exact delivery mechanism, retry behavior, and notification-list UX are `To verify`.
* Whether `BusinessContextReferences` and `TargetContext` are persisted as nested objects or flattened fields is `To verify`.

### Activity

**Description:** Campus-scoped activity created by a host student, defining category, time, location, participation mode, and slot limits.

**Module / Area:** Hosting and Lifecycle / `DS-HL-001 Activities`.

**Relationships:** Scoped by `Campus`, hosted by `Student Account`, classified by `Activity Category`, uses `Campus Location` as meeting point, receives `Participation`, may be reported through `Report Record`, and may be referenced by `Notification Record`.

#### Validation Notes

* `Pending Approval` is not an `Activity.Status`; it belongs to `Participation.Status`.
* The repository wiki includes `deleted` in conservative state vocabulary, but the updated source and H\&L workdoc treat deletion as hard deletion rather than a persisted activity status.
* `CategoryID` must be constrained to an `Activity Category` option from `DS-CA-002`.
* `MeetingPointID` must be constrained to a `Campus Location` option from `DS-CA-002`.

#### Open Questions

* Upper bound for `MaxParticipants` is `To verify`.
* Whether activity deletion will ever need a tombstone or stored `deleted` state is `To verify` if future requirements change hard-delete behavior.

#### Validation Notes

* Declined records are retained for traceability according to the updated source.
* Withdraw and leave flows hard-delete the corresponding participation/request records in the current D\&P/H\&L model.
* A no-duplicate constraint per student-activity pair is described in relationship notes but not backed by an implementation schema in the repository.

#### Open Questions

* Exact schema-level uniqueness constraint for `(ActivityID, StudentAccountID)` is `To verify`.
* Exact H\&L representation of pending-request consequences after a block is `To verify`.

### Block Relationship

**Description:** Directed record of one student blocking another student, with reciprocal enforcement across visibility, detail access, profile access, joining, and notifications.

**Module / Area:** Safety and Moderation / `DS-SM-001 Block Relationships`.

**Relationships:** Initiated by `Student Account` and targets another `Student Account`.

| CreatedAt          | DateTime                    | Yes      | System-generated at creation | Timestamp for when the block was established.      | ISO 8601. Non-null and immutable after creation.                                      |

#### Validation Notes

* The record is directed, but current business enforcement is reciprocal for supported visibility and interaction effects.
* Blocking prevents activity feed visibility, activity detail access, profile detail exposure, new join/request interactions, and cross-user notification delivery.
* Existing shared participation is not automatically removed by a block.

#### Open Questions

* Duplicate block-pair prevention, including whether `(InitiatorAccountID, BlockedAccountID)` is unique, is `To verify`.
* Exact H\&L handling of pending requests after a new block is `To verify`.

### Report Record

**Description:** Submitted moderation report about a user or activity, including reporter, target, reason, details, campus scope, review state, admin outcome, and moderation action trace.

**Module / Area:** Safety and Moderation / `DS-SM-002 Report Records`.

**Relationships:** Scoped by `Campus`, submitted by `Student Account`, conditionally targets `Student Account` or `Activity`, and records review metadata for a campus admin identifier.
